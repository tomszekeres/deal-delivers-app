  "safetyTips": "We have enhanced our already robust cleaning techniques and routines. In particular, we are paying special attention to the places people touch such as card machines, door handles and other hard surfaces.  Following our well established and EHO validated policies and procedures, we are cleaning our facilities and equipment frequently with recommended sanitizing products and encouraging all employees to be vigilant about frequent hand washing.  In the shop we have two permanent air sterilisers in constant operation. Whilst not being clinically tested against Coronavirus, they actively seek and eliminate bacteria, viruses, mould, and fungi found in the air and on all surfaces.  We continue to source our products only from recognised and accredited suppliers.  In addition, we are taking steps to ensure the welfare of our employees.",
