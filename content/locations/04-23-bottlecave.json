  "description": "BOTTLECAVE is an independent craft beer and wine store. We are passionate about wine and beer and constantly strive to offer an honest, personal and reliable service. We are small enough to care and big enough to cope.  We specialise in a comprehensive range of wines & beers from all corners of the globe. BOTTLECAVE was conceived and nurtured out of our passion for food and wine and our overriding aim is to supply quality wines that are made with passion, integrity and uniqueness of origin whilst being true to environmental and ethical issues. For this reason we offer a wide range of biodynamic and organic wines alongside a very large selection of organic and non-organic ales, lagers, ciders and beers from micro breweries."
