  "description": "We are green-fingered cousins living in Brockley and Ladywell and have recently launched our business selling dehydrated wildflower arrangements (which will last for years if properly looked after). Whether you're looking for a longer-lasting alternative to fresh flowers, a standout way to style a corner of your home, or just want to bring a bit more of the outside inside, they are a unique and beautiful solution. With flowers and foliage sourced from the South Coast near Brighton and inspired by South East London's greenery, we have three different arrangements to choose from. We are currently hand-delivering to a selection of SE London postcodes."
