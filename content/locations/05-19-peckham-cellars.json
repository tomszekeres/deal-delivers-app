  "safetyTips": "We wear masks and gloves at all times and change gloves between drops. Whilst also washing our hands and sanitising as regularly as possible. We are made up of people from 2 houses and we try as much as possible not to come in to contact with each other but if we do we always maintain a 2-metre distance. We drop the wine on the doorstep ring the bell and walk 2 metres back to wait for someone to open the door and collect the wine.",
