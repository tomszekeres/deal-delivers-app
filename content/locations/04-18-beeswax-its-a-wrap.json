  "description": "Beeswax Its A Wrap is part of Dulwich Kitchen. Beeswax wraps are an eco alternative to cling film, ideal for keeping food fresh longer. They are lovingly hand-made in Dulwich using locally sourced beeswax. The nature of the beeswax means they are antibacterial, re-usable, compostable and last for 6 months - 1 year. They can also be refreshed - SAY NO TO PLASTIC.  **With each purchase you will receive a FREE packet of RHS Pollinator seeds to look after our bees. ** KIDS AT HOME - we are currently very busy selling Insectlore's Butterfly Raising Kit - allowing you to watch as you grow your own butterflies.  BAKING Products -YEAST is in very short supply but we have just received stock of Fermipan Instant Dried Yeast. We also hold stocks of bread improver and Carrs strong bread flour. We also stock kitchenware items such as cake tins, bread tins, cookie cutters and all things kitchen. The kitchenware part of the site is currently being uploaded. Due to these busy times we are running on skeleton staff and thus unable to take phone calls as we are busy picking and dispatching orders, please email us with any queries!"
