  "description": "A new brand from Dulwich Kitchen. Beeswax wraps are an eco alternative to cling film: antibacterial, reusable, compostable and last for 6-12 months. They are lovingly hand made in Dulwich using locally sourced beeswax. We are also selling Insectlore's Butterfly Raising Kit, Fermipan Instant Dried Yeast, and hold stocks of strong bread flour. We also stock kitchenware items such as cake tins, bread tins, cookie cutters and all things kitchen."
