  "safetyTips": "Fresh bread is a particularly safe product. It is heated to a surface temperature of 230oC and the inside gets to 97oC, which kills all bacteria and viruses. My bakery and working practices were recently inspected by Dover Council Environmental Health and were awarded 5 stars. Once it is baked, the bread is transferred to clean trays to cool and then to a purpose made compostable bag. Your delivery will be left in your designated space. The delivery person will stand at least 2m away from your door in your presence and sanitize their hands/gloves before and after your delivery.",
