  "description": "We set out 12 months ago to fight climate change and deforestation, one 100% recycled loo-roll at a time. With a commitment to plant a tree for every roll sold. Then Coronavirus came along and changed the world as we knew it. It created massive pressure on the NHS, and toilet paper briefly vanished from our shelves. So Serious Tissues is still 100% recycled, but until the Coronavirus crisis is over weâ€™ll be donating 100% of our profits to the NHS. These emergency funds, in aid of the NHS Charities Together COVID-19 Urgent Appeal, will provide food and refreshments to front-line NHS staff and volunteers at the end of 12 hour shifts, as well as helping cover the costs of travel, parking and accommodation.",
