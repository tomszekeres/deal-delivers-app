  "description": "A small event and wedding florist based in Nunhead. We're now offering fresh seasonal flowers and bunches delivered to your home. A little floral magic to those who can't leave the house. I’m dropping contact-free, seasonal flowers to SE postcodes each Saturday. Payment is via bank transfer, no contact necessary. Bunch prices: Small £25, Medium £35, Large £50. Order by midnight on Tuesday for delivery the following Saturday. Order by DM, call, text or email. Nominate a local keyworker who lives in the delivery zone, and I’ll pick one person each week to get free flowers delivered to their home."
