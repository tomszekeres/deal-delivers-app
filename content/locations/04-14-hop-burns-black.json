  "safetyTips": "We're continuing to do our utmost to keep you and our team safe and protected. Our online orders are prepared in our closed-to-the-public Peckham base, which is deep cleaned at the start and end of every day, with all surfaces and points of contact sanitised after use. Our team is fully briefed on best practice hygiene and we operate social distancing at all times in-store (apart from Jen and Glenn, they’re allowed to get a bit closer to each other if they fancy). We use fresh sterilised latex gloves and antibac wipes to pack and deliver your orders, with no-contact deliveries as standard. We've also consulted with our delivery partners to ensure they are taking the greatest care when delivering your goods to protect both you and themselves.",
