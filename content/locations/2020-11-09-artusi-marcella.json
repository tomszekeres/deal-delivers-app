  "description": "Our Home Delivery service is back up and running to help us all get through the lockdown blues this winter. We've got a new-look website, and new dishes coming on all the time. We currently have two options for shipping; if you live in selected postcodes near the restaurants we will deliver to you ourselves for a £5 charge. If you live further afield, we will ship your order in temperature controlled packaging via dpd at a charge of £10. We have a minimum order of £35 before shipping charge."
