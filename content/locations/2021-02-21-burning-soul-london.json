  "description": "Burning Soul London is a high-end candle company started during the first Covid-19 lockdown by Steve Hamilton, a musician by trade, when his industry shuddered to a halt. Built on community, sustainability, and quality, Burning Soul takes empty wine bottles from friends across South London then turns them into beautiful, contemporary, handmade candles with a high-quality burn.
