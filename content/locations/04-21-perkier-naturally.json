The soaps come beautifully packaged in slim, letterbox friendly boxes (recycled and recyclable). Please note, my websiteâ€™s payment system is not running yet, so each product is showing as out of stock to avoid attempted payments through the website. Please use our website (https://www.perkiernaturally.co.uk) as a reference point, and email me to place your order and arrange delivery.",
