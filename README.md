Dulwich Delivers is a simple directory of independent businesses offering local delivery. Enabling people to stay at home and save lives, while supporting the high streets.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

Sorry if these instructions aren't up to much, but here's what you need to do.

Fork this project, rename it to match your town or neighbourhood, get set up on Netlify, and link Netlify to the forked repository.

Lots of code will need editing - you'll need to change the email sign-up form to be your own Mailchimp account, among other changes. Please also change the colour scheme on the favicons and headers - or create your own.

Once your site is up and running you'll be able to log in to the CMS via /admin/index.html.

You'll need a Cloudinary account - this is the CDN that the images are hosted on.
